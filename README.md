Actually, there's nothing much to pay attention to. Since I'm a beginner, I don't understand a lot of things, so please bear with me. My code is very basic and not very valuable, so everyone can evaluate it objectively and point out its flaws, and you can use it freely. But if any other issues arise, I won’t be responsible!
其实没有什么注意的，因为我是初学者，所以我对很多东西不懂，请见谅。我的代码都是很低级的，没什么含金量，所以大家也可以客观评价并指出缺点，也可以随意使用，但如果出了啥其他问题，我可不会负责哦！
